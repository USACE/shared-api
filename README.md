# Shared API

An Application Programming Interface (API) to manage information that is used in multiple applications but does not belong to one specific application.  Built with Golang and Deployed as a Container.

## Local Development

The API can be run using the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) debugger with the the launch.json file provided in this repository or using docker-compose by running the command `docker compose up --build` from the repository root. Either option will launch the API at `localhost:80`.
